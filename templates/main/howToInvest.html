    <h2>
        Choosing your account type
    </h2>
    <div class="pb-3">
        There are 3 main account types available to canadians:
    </div>
    <h3 class="pb-1">
        1. Tax free savings account (TFSA)
    </h3>
    <p class="pb-3">
        The TFSA is arguably the best account available to canadians. With this account, you don't have to pay taxes
        on the gains you make on your investments. This is the account most people will want to max out first.
        But, there's a limit on the amount of money you can contribute to this account, depending on your age.
        You can go on the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) website to see what is your TFSA contribution limit.
    </p>
    <h3 class="pb-1">
        2. Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)
    </h3>
    <p class="pb-3">
        This account is similar to the TFSA, but you will pay taxes on your money once you withdraw it in the future.
        For this reason, the RRSP is an account best suited to save for retirement, because you will likely be in a
        lower tax bracket at that time, so you will pay less tax on the money you withdraw. The RRSP also has a
        contribution limit that you can see on the CRA's website.
    </p>
    <h3 class="pb-1">
        3. Personal account
    </h3>
    <p class="pb-5">
        All interests, dividends and capital gains earned will be taxed in a personal account.
    </p>
</div>
