# Investing Made Simple

## Motivation
I created this little website on investments because it is one of my passions and also to learn the basics of Python, more specifically the Django framework.

## Build status
The website is working but I still want to add features to it, like comments from users and a french translation.

## Tech/framework used
- Frontend : HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Backend : Python 3.9, with the Django framework
- I also used Chart JS in order to make interactive graphs and charts.

## Features
The main focus on this project was to make the website as easy as possible to understand, with a clean user interface.

## Link to the published website (TODO)
